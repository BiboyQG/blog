      <description>3.12 Managed to understand the whole code base of the CLIP repo from OpenAI. Planned to take a look at CAT-Seg: Cost Aggregation for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation, to understand how to implement Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) using CLIP.
3.13 1. DETR Got a basic understanding of DETR, which is an awesome end-to-end 2D object detection architecture, with its downside lies in:
Long training period Difficulty of detecting small objects but has advantages in:</description>

      <description>1. Selected and customized the YOLOv5 model for Chinese chess annotation data. 2. Conducted testing and analysis of the model. The results indicated exceptional accuracy in recognition capabilities. However, a significant shortfall was identified in terms of efficiency, with the model taking approximately 6 seconds to process a single image.
3. Implemented model optimization. We substitute the YOLOv5 model with a more lightweight variant, YOLOv5-lite and convert the model into the ONNX format to leverage hardware acceleration, thereby enhancing computational efficiency.</description>
