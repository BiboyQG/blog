After countless hours of tweaking and optimizing, I've finally crafted a macOS development environment that perfectly suits my workflow. This blog post takes you through my complete dotfiles setup, explaining each component and how they work together to create a productive, efficient development experience.

## üéØ Philosophy

My dotfiles are built around three core principles:
- **Efficiency**: Everything should be accessible with minimal keystrokes
- **Aesthetics**: A beautiful terminal environment that inspires creativity
- **Automation**: Reduce repetitive tasks through smart automation

## üöÄ Quick Setup

Before diving deep, here's how to set up everything:

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) first by booting into Recovery Mode and running `csrutil disable`.

```bash
# Install prerequisite tools
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
curl https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh | sh

# Clone and setup dotfiles
git clone git@github.com:BiboyQG/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles
zsh setup.sh
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Deep Dive
